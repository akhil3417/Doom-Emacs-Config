# Description

-   Well this is my Doom Emacs Config , this config has pretty much everything I could find useful from reading other emacs users.
-   This config can be reproduced on vanilla emacs as I was previously an vanilla emacs user.
-   If you want to use this config just use one part at a time as this is an experimental Config
-   Some of the people by whom the config is Inspired are :
    -   DistroTube
    -   Prot(Protesilaos)
    -   tecosaur
    -   System Crafters
    -   Karthik
    -   and many more which I can't recall at the moment
