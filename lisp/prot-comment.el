When called interactively, the list of possible keywords is that
of `prot-comment-comment-keywords', though it is possible to
input arbitrary text.

If point is at the beginning of the line or if line is empty (no
characters at all or just indentation), the comment is started
there in accordance with `comment-style'.  Any existing text
after the point will be pushed to a new line and will not be
turned into a comment.

If point is anywhere else on the line, the comment is indented
with `comment-indent'.

The comment is always formatted as 'DELIMITER KEYWORD DATE:',
with the date format being controlled by the variable
`prot-comment-timestamp-format-concise'.

With optional VERBOSE argument (such as a prefix argument
`\\[universal-argument]'), use an alternative date format, as
specified by `prot-comment-timestamp-format-verbose'."
