When called interactively, the list of possible keywords is that
of `prot-comment-keywords', though it is possible to input
arbitrary text.

If point is at the beginning of the line or if line is empty (no
characters at all or just indentation), the comment is started
there in accordance with `comment-style'.  Any existing text
after the point will be pushed to a new line and will not be
turned into a comment.

If point is anywhere else on the line and the line is not empty,
the comment is appended to the line with `comment-indent'.

The comment is always formatted as DELIMITER KEYWORD DATE:, with
the date format being controlled by the variable
`prot-comment-timestamp-format-concise'.  DELIMITER is the value
of `comment-start', as defined by the current major mode.

With optional VERBOSE argument (such as a prefix argument), use
an alternative date format, as specified by
`prot-comment-timestamp-format-verbose'."
