;; MCT extension which Treats the Completions as the Minibuffer.  It
;; intercepts any single character input (without Control or Alt
;; modifiers) in the Completions' buffer and passes it to the minibuffer
;; as input.  This practically means that the user can (i) narrow the
;; list of candidates from the minibuffer, (ii) switch to the
;; Completions in anticipation of selecting a candidate, (iii) change
;; their mind and opt to narrow further, (iv) type something to bring
;; focus back to the minibuffer while narrowing to the given input.
;;
;; When the `mct-tcm-mode' is enabled and the above sequence of events
;; takes place, the current session is treated as if it belongs to the
;; `mct-completion-passlist' (read its doc string).

  "MCT extension which Treats the Completions as the Minibuffer.
It intercepts any single character input (without Control or Alt
modifiers) in the Completions' buffer and passes it to the
minibuffer as input.  This practically means that the user
can (i) narrow the list of candidates from the minibuffer, (ii)
switch to the Completions in anticipation of selecting a
candidate, (iii) change their mind and opt to narrow
further, (iv) type something to bring focus back to the
minibuffer while narrowing to the given input.
