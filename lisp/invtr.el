;;; Commentary:
;;
;; INVTR or "Inventory" or else "INVTR Needn't Vindicate Thorough
;; Rationalists" is toy of an inventory management setup that handles
;; the creation of entries and the recording of data within them.  It
;; does not reinvent grep, find, dired, and friends.  Just use those.
;; Instead, it relies on a structured file format that is easy to target
;; with regular expressions.  INVTR extends USLS, which is another toy
;; program of mine.  Read the USLS documentation about the file format
;; and the general workflow (I might do a comprehensive video one day).
;;
;; The target audience of INVTR is small business owners who want to go
;; bankrupt.  Seriously though, DON'T USE THIS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
;; PROGRAM.  I might turn it into a useful package at some point, either
;; on its own or by rewriting USLS, but until then DO NOT USE THIS.  I
;; am just coming up with reasons to play with Elisp.
;;
;; The URL noted above does not exist yet.  Will add it when/if I think
;; this can be remotely useful.
