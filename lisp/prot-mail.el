;;;; Mode line indicator

;; NOTE 2021-05-14: The following is a more generic approach that uses
;; find to search for new mail.  In my prot-notmuch.el I define an
;; alternative that checks for the "unread" tag, which works better for
;; my particular setup (refer to my prot-emacs.org for the relevant
;; commentary).
